#1. Operating Systems and Building Them.

a. Choosing Your OS
Choosing your os if you're going to use your sbc as game console or multimedia player.I probably recommend you to use Android roms such as https://blogs.yajatkumar.com/ (Yajatkumar's OmniRom)
But if you're with Linux then avoid using official google drive builds they are so outdated.(don't use official android rom too)
Instead Use Armbian xfce https://www.armbian.com/orange-pi-zero-2w/ but I prefer building my own Armbian or OrangePi OS. Sometimes Armbian breaks itself or not performs well as Orange Pi OS in my opinion.

b. Building Your Own OS
To build your own OS you need a Ubuntu machine or if you're using Arch Linux/Debian or Maybe Windows you need a virtual machine like Qemu Virt-Manager or WSL
